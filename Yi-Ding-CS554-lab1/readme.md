# CS-554 Lab 1
## Reviewing API Development

For this lab, you will submit a web server with the supplied routes and middlewares.

|Verb |	Route |	Description |
|----|----|----|
|GET	|/api/tasks |	Shows a list of tasks, with optional querystring parameters ?skip and ?take; will show up to 20 tasks by default, and max of 100 at a time |
| GET	 | /api/tasks/:id |	Shows the task with the supplied ID |
| POST |	/api/tasks |	Creates a task with the supplied detail and returns created object; fails request if not all details supplied
|PUT|	/api/tasks/:id |	Updates the task with the supplied ID and returns the new task object; task: PUT calls must provide all details of the new state of the object! Note you cannot manipulate comments in this route!
| PATCH |	/api/tasks/:id |	Updates the task with the supplied ID and returns the new task object; task: PATCH calls only provide deltas of the value to update! Note you cannot manipulate comments in this route! |
| POST |	/api/tasks/:id/comments	 | Adds a new comment to the task; ids must be generated by the server, and not supplied |
|DELETE |	/api/tasks/:taskId/:commentId |	Deletes the comment with an id of commentId on the task with an id of taskId |

All PUT, POST, and PATCH routes expect their content to be in JSON format, supplied in the body.

All routes will return JSON.

## Logging middleware

You will write and apply two middlewares:

1) The first will log all request bodies, as well as the route they are requesting, and the HTTP verb they are using 2) The second will keep track of many times a particular URL has been requested, updating and logging with each request.

## Database

You will use a module to abstract out the database calls.

You may find it helpful to reference the CS-546 lecutre 5 code (Links to an external site.).

You will store all data in a database named as such: LastName-FirstName-CS54-Lab1.

You may name the collection however you would like.

All ids must be generated by the server and be sufficiently random!

## The task object
```json
{
  "id": uuid,
  "title": string,
  "description": string,
  "hoursEstimated": number,
  "completed": boolean,
  "comments": comment[]
}
```

## The comment object
```json
{
  "id": uuid,
  "name": string,
  "comment": string
}
```

## Example task:

```json
{
  "id": "956f8670-3bb3-460f-88cd-24ca7ee9091f",
  "title": "Make lab",
  "description": "Make the first lab for CS-554. Maybe talk about dinosaurs in it, or something",
  "hoursEstimated": 1,
  "completed": false,
  "comments": [
    {
        "id": "d0feb7c1-d4a8-4ca6-a8a7-2ed0a0189e28",
        "name": "Phil",
        "comment": "Considering lab about dinosaurs"
    },
    {
        "id": "3b4e3555-77d3-42af-ae38-03e463e95292",
        "name": "Jason",
        "comment": "Don't do dinosaurs..."
    },
    {

        "name": "Phil",
        "comment": "Maybe make lab about REST?"
    },
    {
        "id": "8372caad-0ec2-477a-a496-1b64534759ec",
        "name": "Jason",
        "comment": "Definitely about REST."
    },

        "name": "Phil",
        "comment": "Would dinosaurs agree with the idempotent standards of REST?"
    },
    {
        "id": "4db0a278-41aa-4e90-add8-2671b48cdb2b",
        "name": "Phil",
        "comment": "Do androids dream of electric velociraptors?"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Checking
1. You must error check all routes
2. You must fail with proper and valid HTTP status codes depending on the failure type

## Notes
1. Remember to submit your package.json file but not your node_modules folder.
